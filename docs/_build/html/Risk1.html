<p><strong>Risk Rating</strong></p>
<p>To determine the overall damage to the project that a risk may have, we applied the likelihood and impact of the risks via a risk matrix to abstract a ‘risk rating’, ranking them from Low, Medium, High and Critical:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
Likelihood</td>
    <td>Impact</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>

    <td>Negligible</td>
    <td>Minor</td>
    <td>Moderate</td>
    <td>Major</td>
    <td>Severe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Very Likely</td>

    <td>Low</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>High</td>
  </tr>
</table><p><strong>Impact Definitions</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Negligible - The impact of the risk will only delay the project by a small number of hours</li>
<li>Minor - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 days</li>
<li>Moderate - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 3-5 days</li>
<li>Major - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 weeks</li>
<li>Severe - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 2 or more weeks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Likelihood definitions</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Very Likely - Occurs once a week</li>
<li>Likely - Occurs once in two weeks</li>
<li>Somewhat Likely - Occurs once in three weeks</li>
<li>Unlikely - Occurs once a month</li>
<li>Very Unlikely - May occur once during the project completion time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk format justification</strong></p>
<p>The risks have been formatted into a table consisting of 3 columns; Risk name and description, Mitigation, and Overall Risk. The rows are sorted into descending order of overall risk rating so risks that would have the biggest impact are clearly visible and distinguishable. Risks are ranked by evaluating negative impact to project and likelihood of possibility.  Table suggest mitigation strategy, that would help effectively solve potential problems.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Ineffective communication between group members</td>
    <td>GitHub and Slack allows effective communicate between group members. Failure to communicate will have a reason. Schedule a special meeting with an elected mediator to allow poor communicators to explain their issue(s) and re-integrate with the team.</td>
    <td>Somewhat Likely/Severe </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Project team misunderstood requirements</td>

important team meetings</td>

Impact</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Member of team is sick and can’t participate in further work</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Overriding each other’s work</td>
    <td>Over-writing other’s work should only occur after proper code review enforced by the pull request system. This review process allows us to ensure any changes removing or changing others’ work to be intended and functional.</td>
    <td>Unlikely/Major</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Internet access is compromised for a prolonged period of time</td>
    <td>Whenever a pull request is approved, all team members should back the repository’s master branch up so that they can work on the game without requiring internet access. 4G data-plans can be activated if necessary to acquire internet connections.</td>
