#Risk Assessment & Mitigation
##Risk Rating

To determine the overall damage to the project that a risk may have, we applied the likelihood and impact of the risks via a risk matrix to abstract a ‘risk rating’, ranking them from Low, Medium, High and Critical:

![image alt text](Risk1Matrix.png)

**Impact Definitions**

* Negligible - The impact of the risk will only delay the project by a small number of hours

* Minor - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 days

* Moderate - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 3-5 days

* Major - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 1-2 weeks

* Severe - The impact of the risk will delay the project by 2 or more weeks

**Likelihood definitions**

* Very Likely - Occurs once a week

* Likely - Occurs once in two weeks

* Somewhat Likely - Occurs once in three weeks

* Unlikely - Occurs once a month

* Very Unlikely - May occur once during the project completion time

## Risk format justification

The risks have been formatted into a table consisting of 3 columns; Risk name and description, Mitigation, and Overall Risk. The rows are sorted into descending order of overall risk rating so risks that would have the biggest impact are clearly visible and distinguishable. Risks are ranked by evaluating negative impact to project and likelihood of possibility.  The table suggests mitigation strategies, that would help effectively solve potential problems.

Failure to communicate will have a reason. Schedule a special meeting with an elected mediator to allow poor communicators to explain their issue(s) and re-integrate with the team.                           | Somewhat Likely/Severe           |
| Project team misunderstood requirements                                                                                    | Following Scrum methodology frequent team meetings are held and requirements are often reviewed.
